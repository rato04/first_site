<h1>Starting your very own kpop binder</h1>
  <title>How to make your own kpop photocard binder</title/>

<font size="4"></body>As fun as it is being a kpop stan collector,it can also be a bit of confusing
if you don't know where to start. Well don't worry, this may help you make the
perfect kpop binder

<h2>Step 1: Gather your materials</h2>
<font size="4"><p>These are some general materials that will help you start your binder. At
  the bottom of the page you will find store names and links for where to
  purchase all the items on the list below

<p>Some people use different colors for different groups but you can just
use plain white.
<p>You can choose different sizes but a normal A4 generally works
  <li>Pocket pages
<ol><p>Standard 9 pocket page
  <p>2-3 pocket page
    <p>Horizontal 3 pocket page and standard 4 pocket page for random items
      you may get in your album
      <p>Standard 4 pocket page
      <p>1 pocket page that can be used as a divider</ol>
<li>White/Color paper if you don't want to see through to the next page and
  also for a cleaner look
  <li>Pocket protectors for your Photocards
    <p> This is optional and is only for extra protection for your Photocards
      <li>Post it/ Sticky notes for planning in your binder
        <li>A notebook for planning your binder layout and decoration

<h3>Step 2: Research</h3>
  <p>The best place to start is knowing what you're dealing with
  <p>Start by checking out the place you bought your album(s) from. There you
    should find listings for the album telling you all the album contents
    e.g:Photocards, posters, stickers etc
    <p>This is where your notebook comes in.
      <p>Write down all your album contents and then decide what theme you would
      like follow in your binder eg:by age of members in oldest to youngest or
      by era's of the group from debut to the most recent comeback.

<h3>Step 3: Creating fillers or using post it notes</h3>
  <p>Once you have done your research, the fun part begins:prepping your pages
    <p>Fillers are generally used for long term or permanent use when you know
      that nothing will be placed in that space e.g Having a 9 pocket page but
      only having 8 photocards for that page.Fillers can also be used for
      decoration.
      <p>Post it/ Sticky notes will be used for short term or temporary use
        when you still plan to put something in a space but don't have it at
        that moment or plan to move things around in your binder

<h3>Step 4: Adding photocards</h3>
  <p>It's important to remember that there is no correct way to go about this,it
  should be true to you and fit how you connect to the group you stan.
  Below are some examples of different themes of photocard placement if you're
  feeling short of ideas

  <h3>Step 5: Additional</h3>

    <p>Once you have decided on your theme and photocard placement and are happy
      with the way your binder looks, you can choose to further decorate it.
      This can be done by adding frames to your photocards and designing a cover
      for the outside of your binder either indicating which group the binder is
      for or anything else you think looks good.
      Here are some examples of ways to design your binder(s):

<h2>Still don't know where to put the rest of the contents of your album?</h2>
  As you read at the beginning, there are many different and random things that
  can come with an album.
  <p> Some examples are:
  <li>Posters
  <li>Standing photocards
  <li>Pop up photocards
  <li>Logo tags
  <li>Postcards
  <li>Message photocards
  <li>Mini photobooks

<p>Collecting these is not as serious as it may look on certain YouTube videos.
  You don't need to go out and buy a whole shelf to place your photobooks and
  lyric books. It would help in the near future if you still plan to collect,
  especially if you are a multi stan, but for now, on top of your dresser will
  be just be fine.
  Here are some examples of where to place different album randoms:



  <p>Remember, there's no specific way your room, wall or whatever you want to
  decorate, should look. Everything should be specific to you and your preferred
  style of doing things.
  I hope this was an informative and helpful start or guide to your kpop
  collectors journey.
  Have fun!</font>
